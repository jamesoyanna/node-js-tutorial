The core project spent over 10 days to document all their learning as 
they were hugely emboldened by this success that they wanted to repeat 
it multiple times. However this could not happen as Raskob’s eldest of 
his 13 children died in a car crash in 1931 and he suddenly changed his
 direction to philanthropy and public service instead of making more construction projects.

The handover was one of the smoothest. Not a single hitch happened on 
the opening day. When New York Times came for survey using a mathematician 
to find out whose building is taller, Raskob told them to “Stuff their mathematics
 in your… “ ( I guess you know where) and invited to them to come up to
  their observation tower to “Look Down On the Chrysler building”.

New York Times played a bit of a villain, because Chrysler used to 
publish a lot of advertisements in NYT, by publishing an article that
 questioned the construction quality and safety while praising the 
 fastest construction and for being the tallest building in the world.
  This affected their immediate sale of offices but soon that myth 
was also broken and within 2 yrs the Empire State Building had full occupancy.
